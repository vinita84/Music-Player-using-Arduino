# Music-Player-using-Arduino
This player varies frequency, wavelength and tempo
Using Piezo Buzzer, Potentiometer, and Push Button, I designed a Music Player which could play the 7 notes using buzzer at different octaves (frequency multiples using potentiometer) and also vary the tempo (using push button).
